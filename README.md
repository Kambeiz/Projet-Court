## About this project

The goal of this project is to re-implement calculations from the [Protein Interactions Calculator](http://pic.mbu.iisc.ernet.in/job.html) webserver, allowing to calculate differents interactions in a given protein structure. Our script is written in Python 3, and requier several packages included in a conda environment ([env.yml](env.yml)) for an user-friendly installation. It also requires an internet connection.

We are students in 2<sup>nd</sup> year of bioinformatics master's Degree, and this work was realised for a short-project. 

## Requirements

To execute the script, you need the folowing Python 3 packages:
  - geckodriver (0.26 version)
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - SciPy
  - Firefox
  - Selenium
  - tabulate

You can find the corresponding conda environment file into the ([repository](env.yml)). 

You also need a protein structure in PDB format that will be used for calculation. 

## Usage 

First, you can get the whole repository by using git clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kambeiz/Projet-Court/
```

Then, once in the `Projet-Court` directory, you can install the requierd packages by creating and activating the conda environment.

```bash
conda env create -f env.yml
conda activate shortproject
```
Finally, you can launch the script with the following command line: 

```bash
python3 src/PIC.py -p data/1BTA.pdb
```
Several options exists, from a help commands to cut-off choice (in Angstrum) for each interaction calculated:

```bash
python src/PIC.py [-h] -p PDB [-hydro HYDROPHOBIC] [-ion IONIC] [-AA A A] [-AS AROMSULPH] [-AC AROMCATION]
```

Which in practice, give you something like :

```bash
python3 src/PIC.py -p data/1BTA.pdb -hydro 6 -ion 5 -AA 5 7 -AS 6 -AC 7
```
